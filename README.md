# simple-etl-dqthon
DQThon is team based programming competition or hackaton. They compete for million rupiah by developing software. 
To join the hackathon event, the team need to register by inputting some data to DQThon registration form. 

In this project, we will try to make simple ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) to process the registration data so the data will be ready to be loaded to the data warehouse.
